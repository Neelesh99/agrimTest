            A spice made from the bark of the Cinnamomum aromaticum tree.
            Cassia bark (both powdered and in whole, or "stick" form) is used as a flavouring agent for confectionery, desserts, pastries, and meat; it is specified in many curry recipes,
            where Ceylon cinnamon is less suitable. Cassia is sometimes added to Ceylon cinnamon, but is a much thicker,
            coarser product. Cassia is sold as pieces of bark (as pictured below) or as neat quills or sticks.
            Indonesian Cassia sticks can be distinguished from Ceylon cinnamon sticks in the following manner:
            Ceylon cinnamon sticks have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or
            spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are extremely hard and are usually made up of one thick layer.
